# **Gaussian Function Plotter**

This MATLAB program allows you to graphically represent a Gaussian function. The Gaussian function is a bell-shaped curve, often used in statistics and natural sciences to represent continuous probability distributions.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Download the file containing the source code gaussian_function.m.
3. Open MATLAB and load the file gaussian_function.m.
4. Run the script by pressing the "Run" button in the MATLAB script editor.

## Parameters

`coef`: This parameter controls the range of values on the x-axis. It sets the values of x from -coef to coef.
`deviation`: The standard deviation of the Gaussian function, controlling the width of the bell.
`hope`: The mean value (or expectation) of the Gaussian function, controlling its central position on the x-axis.

## Result
The program generates a plot representing the Gaussian function based on the specified parameters. The generated curve will have a bell-shaped form centered around the value specified for `hope`, with dispersion controlled by `deviation`.

## About Gaussian Functions
A Gaussian function, also known as a normal distribution or Gaussian bell curve, is a mathematical function that describes a symmetric bell-shaped curve. This curve is characterized by its mean (or expectation) and standard deviation.

The general form of a Gaussian function is given by the equation:

`x`: independent variable.
`μ`: (mu): mean of the distribution.
`σ`: (sigma): standard deviation of the distribution.

The Gaussian function is widely used in statistics, natural sciences, engineering, and many other fields to model phenomena that tend to cluster around a mean value with a characteristic dispersion.

In this program, we use a Gaussian function to generate a bell-shaped curve centered around a specified mean (`hope`) value, with dispersion controlled by the deviation parameter (`deviation`).

## About This Program
This MATLAB program was developed as part of a project to graphically illustrate a Gaussian function. It offers a simple and effective way to generate and visualize Gaussian curves for an intuitive understanding of their properties.

The Gaussian function is widely used in many fields, including statistics, physics, engineering, finance, and artificial intelligence. Its characteristic bell-shaped form makes it a valuable tool for modeling natural phenomena and probability distributions.

This program can be used for educational purposes to introduce the concepts of normal distribution and probability to students, as well as for practical applications such as analyzing experimental data or modeling natural processes.

We hope this program will be helpful in your projects and scientific explorations!
